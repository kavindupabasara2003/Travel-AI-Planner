its a 6 hour dive from colombo - but worth it. | An absolutely beautiful stretch of beach, with a shallow entry and warm waters to enjoy.

It was a bit rough when we visited, but not at all unswimable (3-4Â waves). The heavy surf did product a thick belt of shells, coral and other items at the entry, and a somewhat deep drop at the shore (which quickly levels off), making getting in or out tricky and uncomfortable on the feet.

The only major negative was the amount of waste, plastics and other random debris in the ocean. It was an ugly situation, and detracted from the natural splendour of the place. Sad the people would be so shortsighted and not respect the beautiful surroundings.."

It is made worse by the fact that tourists actually pay to enter the park.  What do they do with the money?  They certainly don't clear up the garbage.

To add to the pollution, speed boats and jetskis tear up and down the small lake continually. Why anyone would want to take a pleasure cruise in this water is beyond me.

Sri Lankan people are in general the friendliest and most generous people you could wish to meet. However, the plastic is becoming a national shame. As a visitor to the country, touring around for six months, the rubbish/garbage/litter in every river, stream and beach is a disgrace. I went for a sea swim and collected 25 plastic bags in 10 minutes. | Move on, nothing to see here.

We had a wonderful time. | Definitely go there if you can. Parking is easy and free for those who self drive and the climb is not so hard. About 150m of elevation but on good steps. The view from the top on surrounding jungle is amazing.  | Definitely a must-visit if you are in center-north Sri Lanka. The views from the bottom/garden are already great, but from the top it looks amazing.
Not recommended for people with vertigo (due to the last round of steps) or impaired mobility.
Climbing is easy even for elder people as long as you make a few stops on the way up (I went with my father 65+ Yo, that has some problems doing long walks / climbing, but stopping a few times worked out very well for him. Managed to go up and down in a total time of 57 minutes).

The history of this place is also very interesting. You can get leaflets at entrance. Expect lots of locals trying to guide you up (I think its totally unnecessary to hire one specially considering the very poor English skills..but it's up to you. They will try hard).

The only bad thing is families that don't respect the wasp warning signs resulting in incidents. Wasps can be triggered by sound - as advertised everywhere. Unfortunately we saw families with kids screaming, loud music and others crying out loud precisely in the designated ""Wasp attack zone"". Avoid going with kids to keep this place safe for everyone or at least take them to non-attack zones.."

However conditions were extremely challenging in parts and 22000 steps later many of us were exhausted. We were advised not to take plastics into the National Park so were without water which was a mistake. DO take water with you. Lovely scenery although most of the walk/climb you look down to check your feet placing. | A great mornings hike in the park , the terrain can get slippy and challenging with high steps but shouldnÂt worry any person is in reasonable shape and take your time . A couple of toilets along the route but not a western standard so be prepared . Bring plenty of water and start early , Worlds end is a great stopping point with awesome views , lots of wildlife to be on the look out for. | We started our hike through Horton Plains early in the morning to catch a sunrise over the misty hills and terrains. What can I say, it was definitely worth waking up so early. We saw plenty of deers eating fresh grass even before we entered the main gate of the park, and then had an enjoyable walk along the route towards Baker's Falls. 

There are two options: you can start with the Falls and finish by the Little World's End or vice versa. We chose the first option and did not regret it. After we saw the sunrise, the sun quickly disappeared behind the clouds and we did not see it much until we reached the falls and the skies became blue. We took wonderful photos and had our packed breakfast right there on a bench, which was so romantic and enjoyable.

When we continued our route towards the World's End, we realized how right we were in taking that path - we almost always hiked down rather than climbing up and it made our trekking way more comfortable and less tiring. The day before we hiked the Adam's Peak, so we could not feel our legs and feet after that and this path we chose turned out to be helpful :) 

Unfortunately, when we reached the World's End, a big cloud hung on top and covered all the view. We waited for 30 minutes and the situation remained the same. We still were pleased with the hike and the World's End because there was a certain mystery in this endless mist over the edge. You can literally feel you are on the edge of nowhere.

P.S. In my opinion, you won't need a guide to hike Horton Plains. It is super easy and it is impossible to get lost on the way. There is literally only one path and it is a round journey, so whatever way you choose - you will end up in the same place. Only if a lady is solo and scared of being attacked or something??? But generally, for me it seemed peaceful and safe. And if a leopard comes out from a bush, I don't think that having a guide will be helpful right??)))

Also the time you will spend there will be at least 4-5 hrs if you do not want to run along the whole route and wish to take nice pictures and just enjoy the nature around you. So don't listen to people who tell it is like a 3-hour hike. Maybe, if you don't complete the whole circle..)."

But people should restrain from polluting the place with plastics.  | It is an amazing place to visit. A not to hard climb to the topÂ but when you get there, the view and the waterfall are amazing. | This was one of our favourite days in Sri Lanka. Definitely worth a visit.

As others say below, you can go with or without a guide. We had a guide from Ella whose company we really enjoyed, so we went up with him Â but you could definitely find your way without a guide if you wanted to, maybe with a wrong turn or two along the way.

We took the short 20-minute walk rather than the 2-hour hike, and didnÂt regret it.

The bottom pool is the busiest with tourists Â but we found it was only really worth a short stay. The views are beautiful, and this is where everyone gets their photos Â but thatÂs pretty much it.

The second pool, a very short walk away, is good for a swim, and the view of the falls above you is pretty special. 

The third pool, directly above the second, and a short 2-3 minute hike up, features an 8m cliff jump. We did it and were perfectly safe Â but I wouldnÂt do it without being shown by a local guide. There are plenty around the first pool who can show you. We did it a couple of times Â every time, my feet hit the bottom of the pool at the end of the jump, but not hard enough to be of any concern Â just a surprise first time around!

We then had a lovely time at the top of the third pool, sitting in the sun and relaxing. Well worth a trip.."

I recommend. | May be it is my twelfth visit! Several stepped Ravana falls has always been the main attraction to visitors to Ella. Columns of clear water with bubbles and froth mixed in it  like a thick lace curtain makes it a picture to stare at. It was interesting to see the surrounding rock faces through a telephoto lens or binoculars where I could spot rock shelters or semi caves in the upper region of the hill. I wonder whether ancient humans lived in them during the stone ages. 

 | Ravana Falls, located just 10 minutes away from Ella by bus, is a must-visit destination for anyone exploring the region. One of the main attractions of the falls is the stunning views it offers, with water cascading down from a height of over 80 feet. The lush greenery surrounding the falls adds to its natural beauty, making it a picture-perfect spot for photography enthusiasts.

Visitors can also enjoy the playful monkeys that can be spotted around the waterfall. These furry creatures are often seen jumping from tree to tree and adding to the fun atmosphere around the falls.

Apart from the scenic views and playful monkeys, visitors can also take a refreshing swim in the cool waters of the pool at the base of the falls. The water is crystal clear, and the pool offers a great spot to cool off after a day of exploring the area.

In summary, Ravana Falls in Ella is a picturesque destination that offers breathtaking views, playful monkeys, and the opportunity to take a refreshing swim in the pool at the base of the falls. It's a great spot for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike, and it's definitely worth a visit when exploring the region.."

After you pay the entrance fee almost nothing is in English. You have to open google to get at least some information.

We had a disagreement with the staff I took as 15 mins to find someone who can speak basic English. Or at least clean up at the historical sites from all the garbage.

Recent travelers said: Our guide took us in the evening to see the great buddha tooth - we queued for over 30mins in the heat (no AC inside and lots of people) with people trying to push infront of us! When finally the awful loud procession music stopped, the queue moved forward to see the tooth - except is behind about 2 distance walls of glass and you're not allowed to stop so I had no idea what i was looking at, honestly comical. And locals leave offering to the 'buddha tooth' that the monks love im sure. 
The temple itself is lovely, lots of detail, nice paintings but don't go with the crowds in the evening its not worth it. Enjoy it at a quieter time to take it all in. 
(Note - there is a place to store shoes outside as you have to take them off so pack socks as the floor is dirty) 
Theres also a weird room with a huge stuffed elephant that the president or someone loved. After going to the elephant freedom project sanctuary earlier in the week (highly recommend) it felt cruel he had this as a pet in his garden. | Visited in the evening with some ongoing rain. You don't get to see the tooth even from a distance and there is an entry ticket of 1500 SLR for foreigners. Can avoid if you are not a pilgrim. | If you are not a religious person that understands where to go, when and what's happening there at that moment, you won't enjoy the place much, neither the ceremony that happens at the place when it's open to the public. Not to mention that the place is a maze and it took me and my boyfriend some time to get to the entrance that we needed. Different prices for locals and for tourists are present also here, as everywhere else at Sri Lanka. 
The ceremony is a mass activity where a lot of people pushes themselves to a certain place at the temple, and you push yourself to get there also, since you don't know why are others pushing themselves so much. The fact it, the religious people want to give their offerings to the temple and to Buddha. You will end up in a room where everyone is packed, waiting to get to the room for offerings, where you won't get. So since you know about this now, you don't need to push yourself together with them and I have just saved you some time and nerves. 
Instead of pushing yourself with the mass, I recommend you to walk around the temple and the parts that are accessible for the visitors, and e.g. burn some candles as your offering outside. The place looks magical, especially in the evening when it's already dark outside. To burn something, you need to buy a special oil for that. I didn't figure out where to do that, unfortunately. 
What got me was a payment payment machine looking as an ATM that could be used for donations for the temple. Like wow. A way to go, The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic! This is what I call progress. ."
